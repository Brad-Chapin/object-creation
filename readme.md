#Creating Objects in Javascript

###Follow the instructions in ```main.js``` to satisfy the following objectives:
- Copy objects with ```Object.assign```
- Create objects with explicit prototypes with ```Object.create```

Use the MDN documentation on ```Object.assign()``` and ```Object.create()``` as necessary.
